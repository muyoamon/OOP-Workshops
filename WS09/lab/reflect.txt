***********************************************************************/

In this Workshop, I learnt about inheritance and polymorphism. I think
the content of this workshops is pretty similar to the last workshop
If I recall correctly, the only difference is we have to write entire 
library ourself.

The most recent milestone I did is ms3 and ms4. The content of both
milestone is very similar. The only difference is that ms4 is more
complex. However I think that ms3 is harder than ms4 because ms4 is
inherit from ms3. If ms3 is without a problem then ms4 is most likely
without a problem

The most annoying part of those milestone is formatting output.
without using iomanip I feel like they are sometimes a hassle.
