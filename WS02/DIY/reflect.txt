In this workshop I learn about dynamic memory allocation. I find that 
dynamic memory allocation is quite useful when you want an array that is
initialize at runtime and not compile time. Although, I still get a bit 
confuse when dynamic sizing string because sometimes I think that instead
of string, I should declare a pointer to string instead. Thus, making me
a bit confuse in this workshop but everything else is just fine.
