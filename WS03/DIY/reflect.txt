//I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code 
//that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

in this workshops, I learn about class and encapsulation. I find that class is quite handy
because we can have a method that modify class member variables without passing it through
the parameters. Class can also hide private member variables and also function which can make
program more secure and it is a good design to expose a part of logic only when needed to.

In this workshops, I find that it is easier compare to the last workshops. However, I have
a hard time formatting the output. I still feel like the printf formatting is easier
compare to C++ std::cout but I believe that std::cout is more versatile compared to printf.

Also, in the Icecream class I try using static member variable instead of dynamic array.
I believe that using dynamic array will use less memory however I do not want to deal without
memory leaks.
