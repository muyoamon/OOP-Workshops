In this workshop, I learned about member operator overload and helper operator.
I overload member operator to make operating on object simpler compared to using
function while retaining similarity of operator. For example, in this DIY workshop,
we use greater than operator (>) to check if Hero's power level is greater than 
the other's hero object power level.

In this workshop, one thing I had difficulty in particular is dealing with pass-by-reference.
The reason being in some function I forgot to pass a parameter by reference, and sometimes, it
create additional object instead of referencing. It is not a hard bug to fix but I had a hard
time noticing it so it take a lot of time debugging.

Also, this is not something I find difficulty but because I am not careful. when I read the Power.h
I thought that it has dynamic memory allocation. I only noticed when I finished my first implementation.
So I need to make some tweaks.
