  In this workshops, I learned about namespace, modular design as well as 
new library iostream, which truly serve as a great introduction to 
object-oriented programming. The use of namespace is what I find very
beneficial because you can have 2 variable of the same name as long as they
are not in the same namespace. Although, I cannot truly understand the practical usage yet I believe it is going to be impactful in the future. 
Modular design is already taught in IPC144. I mention it here because the
introduction of namespace which is very helpful. iostream library introduce
new method to input-output. Instead of throwing varaible as a argument of
a function like printf in C, we use >> and << operator instead. I believe
this is what we need to wrap our head on to be able to understand OOP 
mindset. 
  In this workshop, I find DIY part difficult because of no guidance
and restriction. In IPC144, almost every workshops have certain 
restriction to we you can and what you cannot. In this workshop, however,
there are no restriction, leaving implementation to students. There are
many variety of possible solutions and the hardest part of all is to decide
which one to implement.
