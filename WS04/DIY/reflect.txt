  In this workshops, I learn about Construction, Destruction, Member operator and Helper function. 
  The constructor is a function that is called when The object is created. 
It is used to initialize the value of the object. It can be overloaded. 
  The destructor is a function that is called when object is destroyed/ go out of scope
used to garbage collect the dynamic memory. It cannot be overloaded.
  The member operator is a feature of C++ language that allow us to overload the operator
to be able to use with user-defined object type. In this workshops I overloaded the == operator
to compare the GuitarStr object.
  The helper function is a function outside of class definition. It is used when the function is
loosely relate to functionality of class. For example, comparison. However to have a helper function
instead of member function, the class require the query function to do its work properly.

  In this workshops, I don't find anything in particular to be difficult However I still aren't able
to handle dynamic memory properly and didn't set the pointer to be null pointer which I believe the 
more workshops I do I will be able to rid of this problem.
