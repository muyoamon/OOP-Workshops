In this workshops, I primarily learn about Inheritance.
When base class get inherit into child class.
all of member type private, public, protected are retained.
However, only public and protected can be accessed.
To access the private member of base class, base class need to 
offer getter setter method.

Also in this workshops, I find myself more familiar with C++
inputstream and how istream >> operator works. if my understanding
is correct, I won't have problem dealing with string input in the 
future.

The most recent milestone I have done is milestone 2.
I consider milestone 2 to be the easiest workshops/milestone I 
ever done since IPC144. I think because the size of milestone is also 
small. If I remember correctly, there are only 1 class to define and 
2 function to implement. I think that's why it is so easy.
